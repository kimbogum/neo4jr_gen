neo4jr_gen
=========

neo4jr_gen is a plugin that provides a generator for Neo4jr scaffolds.

The templates are based loosely on code from

http://github.com/andreasronge/neo4j-rails-example


Example
=======

From your rails root run:

    script/generate neo_scaffold Person name:string dob:date

Then add

    map.resources :people

to routes.rb


To Do
=====

    - automatically insert resource map to routes.rb
    - generate tests
    - better type handling so that properties are generated with proper type definitions

        eg.   property :dob, :type => Date
